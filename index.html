                    <p>I was born on 8th January 2001 in the small state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany.</p>
                    <p>Where i spent like 2-3 years in Schwerin, until i moved one year later to Ludwiglust (a neighbor city in schwerin). </p>
                    <p>In Ludwiglust I first came in contact with an old computer with CRT Monitor, it has Windows XP as operating system.</p>
                    <p>Games like Pokemon or Super Mario were my favorite ones when i owned a Game Boy back then.</p>
                    <p>With my Half-Brother and my sister and Parents i've lived there for 3 years until we moved to Hamburg.</p>

                <h2>My past to the present</h2>
                <p>When I moved with my parents to Hamburg in 2007, It was kinda hard for me at beginning to accept my new home.</p>
                <p>I slowly got better familiar with my new home, we had kind elderly neighbors who gifted us with various things.</p>
                <p>From the time i developed an interest for LEGO,  where i built many stuffs such like buildings or animals.</p>
                <p>In 2012, I found out about my artistical side due to an drawing application when i began to play with Nintendo DSi.</p>
                <p>Most of my childhood time i spent with a school colleague which i've become friends until today, where we played games like Mario Kart.</p>
                <p>Graduated with an Highschool Degree in 2018 I began to looking for apprenticeships, where i began to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript in an educational institution in Altona until 2019</p>
                <p>From 2020-2021 I was still looking for a apprenticeship, where I start improving my programming skills further.</p>
                <p>Since mid-2021 I become a student of the Joblinge, where they gonna help me getting me further to my dream job.</p>

                <h2>First Contact about computer science</h2>
                <p>When I had that old computer in Ludwigslust, I played around in Firefox browser where I</p>
                <p>Accidentally clicked the Inspect section and saw the source code of the Website.</p>
                <p>I used the Inspect section to change in example the text of the HTML Tags and was astounded when the text of the Website changed.</p>
                <p>After I moved to Hamburg, I was being a little cyber criminal for pirating Games, my half brother was very good in that and demonstrated me how to do that.</p>
                <p>I then began to modify my Nintendo DS console so it was capable in running these pirated Games.</p>
                <p>There was these kinds of nostalgic browser games i used to play in the middle school when we had computer time. With an hex-editing program I began to modify values in these Browser games to get myself an advantage.</p>

                <h2>Real Programming experience</h2>
                <p>After my Highschool graduation, I had a Job-Companion who assisted me in help finding an apprenticeship.</p>
                <p>I told him what kind of job I would like to do, he then told me the exact job which have fit my description.</p>
                <p>That job was called "IT specialist for application development", it was exactly what i wanted to do, i started learning Python with a little success.</p>
                <p>Then some months later I began to learn C, which was a real challenge. Without success finding businesses who wanted to hire me,</p>
                <p>i joined the educational institution in Altona in October 2018, where i intensely learned about HTML and CSS and also had my first internship in a IT-Business</p>
                <p>After my time in the educational institution, I began to learn Javascript on a Website called "Codecademy" it was a good experience.</p>
                <p>During the Covid-Lockdown I began to learn a little more about JavaScript such as Objects or Classes</p>
                <p>Since 2021 I began a little approach on C again and also about Python, but now it's way easier because i had previous experience about these Languages before</p>
